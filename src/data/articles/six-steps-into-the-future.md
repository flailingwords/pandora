6 Steps Into The Future is intended as a framework that instead of writing long detailed plans about what needs to be done, we set the end goal - step 6 - and define the nearest 5 steps to reach this goal.

Once the first step has been marked as done, we can then either continue and add an additional step, or we can reevaluate our next steps.

6 Steps Into The Future is intended as a general framework that can work for both personal productivity and for tackling far reaching issues like climate change.

Example:

We set the goal to launch Flailing Words.

We then break down the steps.

> 1. We get the domain
> 2. We set up hosting
> 3. We figure out platforms/deployments
> 4. We pick frameworks for the sites
> 5. We write content
> 6. We launch Flailing Words

As we're currently onto step 5, we can review our steps.

> 1. We write content
> 2. We release Pandora
> 3. Add Pandora to the main domain site
> 4. Improve connectivity/hosting
> 5. ???
> 6. We launch Flailing Words

As shown, we can easily iterate over our goals by keeping short manageable lists that make us intentionally review our next goals and milestones.

> **Note:** obviously we can always work out other, more distant future steps, and we can even go as far as to pre-package those steps. But by keeping concise critical steps on the "runway", we can more easily adapt and shift towards goals as priorities shift.
