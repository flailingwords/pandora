## Intro

Hi there!

Welcome to the Flailing Words project.

Flailing Words is the catch-all domain/project for various fun, future-focused or public good projects by ponderer, tinkerer and mixed/cross-media artist Nick Harrow that do not fit traditional categories.

The Flailing Words banner will also be available for others to host their projects, if they fit under the banner.

The mission for Flailing Words is to enable experiments that are aimed to follow the 6 Steps Into The Future pattern.

## Imminent Projects

### 6 Steps Into The Future

6 Steps Into The Future is intended as a framework that instead of writing long detailed plans about what needs to be done, we set the end goal - step 6 - and define the nearest 5 steps to reach this goal.

Once the first step has been marked as done, we can then either continue and add an additional step, or we can reevaluate our next steps.

6 Steps Into The Future is intended as a general framework that can work for both personal productivity and for tackling far reaching issues like climate change.

### Future Technologies

The Flailing Words Project also aims to set up infrastructure for future technologies projects.

While we curently have technologies, like 3D printing, that have broken out of the existing molds, in order to deal with imminently changing futures, we will have to rethink and reshape the future and its technologies.

## Core Values

The Flailing Words Project is left-leaning and science affirming.

The Flailing Words Project is founded on the principle that under the current colonialist systems/kyriarchy, trans rights are Black rights are women's rights are Palestinian rights are children's rights are Indigenous rights are queer rights are Brown/Persons of Colour rights are disability rights are health rights, and that because of the interactions of all these power systems, this project upholds the value that Marginalized Lives Matter.

Only in recognizing that humanity rights are universal and immutable, recognizing that science is a fact-based system that changes over time based on better understanding of the world, that no one is above accountability, and that our current systems of power are inherently traumatizing, is it that we can fully acknowledge our common humanity and work towards a better, more peaceful world.

The Flailing Words Project hopes to establish open/"open source" think-tanks to encourage open out-of-the-box conversations to come up with alternatives for a future that will be able to handle global challenges, such as global warming.

Opinions formed under the current colonial system as it has been in place for centuries, will inevitably be informed and constrained by the way of thinking taught by this system and its institutions.

The Flailing Words Project aims to provide a safe, inclusive platform for progressive, non-traditional thinking, without resorting to the gatekeeping that is common to legacy educational institutions.
