# Motivation

The shape of humanity as a whole is abysmal.

The collective authors of this manifesto do not believe that humanity as it is and on its current path, will not survive without a meaningful societal paradigm shift.

This manifesto aims to propose an ultimate set of basic laws, rules and goals to help conversations about what the future might look like.

The authors of this manifesto hold the sincere and foundational belief there are very few paths to get through this with our humanity in tact, which is the motivation for this manifesto and which will be the foundational requirement for anyone contributing to this manifesto.

Only by applying the laws of humanity and equality universally can they be universal.
