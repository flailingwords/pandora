# Stewardship

Stewards are a form of guardian-advocates that have the duty to perform their duties according to the foundational principles.

The problem with current government systems is that those who are charged with protecting life are the same ones advocating for those who seek to exploit life.

This is the foundational incongruity of government and any other organization that represents the needs of those who seek to produce.

The only way to remediate this, is keeping strict separation of duties and by empowering stewards and steward councils to only agree on full consensus.

Example:

> A land/water/air protection council represents the interests of a region of lands, where a manufacturing council seeks to exploit the earth for rare earth metals.

> Only by working together and agreeing on how the land, water and air will be protected, will manufacturing be allowed to proceed.
