# Foundational Principles

1. Humanity applies to all beings equally and universally.
    - In life or death, all beings deserve the same basic dignity, respect, safety and security.
2. The safety and security of a being's own body is the supreme right of a being.
    - Every being has the supreme authority and autonomy over their own body and has the right to exert that freedom and the obligation to respect the consent of the individual, whether their own or that of others.
3. For the collective safety of all beings, we commit to keeping all beings safe.
    - To preserve the sanctity of the previous two rules, commitment to the first rule is a foundational commitment for all and as part of the social contract as a member being of our shared world, we acknowledge and commit to the welfare and safety of all other beings. Acknowledging that this sometimes overrides the second Foundational Principle.
4. All beings have the essential basic right to exist, be fed, sheltered, loved and otherwise be provided for in a for them meaningful way.
    - No one should go without food, hydration or rest.
    - No one should go without safe shelter.
    - No one should go without the care that they require. Be it medical. Be it accessibility needs. Be it otherwise.
    - No one should be separated from their families by arbitrary reasons.
    - No one should have their movement limited for arbitrary reasons.
5. All beings have the right to be educated in any meaningful way, provided that this not violate any of the previous foundational principles.
6. All beings have the right to follow or convey any opinion or belief system as they chose, either alone or in groups, provided that this not violate any of the previous foundational principles.
    - Religion as a personal belief system that motivates one towards personal or societal goals is a fundamental right, as long as those beliefs do not violate any of the previous foundational principles.
7. Stewards/Advocates may be appointed on behalf of any being.
    - Stewards are beholden to the will of the beings they represent as defined in the foundational principles above, and may not act against any of the foundational principles.
    - For all collective obligations, councils of stewards are to be appointed by the peoples in their constituency, with technical measures in place to incorporate continues feedback from the peoples they represent, and if necessary the option to convene a council of stewards for the purposes of accountability.
8. The aforementioned laws are inalienable and are to be accessible to anyone, without limitations, irregardless of economic systems or income status.
    - Providing access to all of the above is the innate obligation of society to all beings as the consequence of having been born.
9. Violators of the foundational principles have the right to a fair and appropriate process of accountability by a council of stewards, which will not impose cruel or unusual punishments, or unnecessarily limit the application of the foundational principles.
    - Processes of accountability shall always aim to resolve issues in peace and humanity, creating the opportunity for healing and learning for both the victims and the perpetrators, while respecting their humanity.
10. Acknowledging the role of various forms of colonialism in Earth's recent history, the prosperous nations have the stewardship, as defined above, duty to provide and care for less prosperous areas.
